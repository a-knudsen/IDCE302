Github cannot create empty folders. So start by adding a new file to your repo, then type the folder name you want (in this case "images") and end it with the "/". 
This automatically creates the new folder, then prompts you to name the file that will sit within that folder (in this case "text"). 
So this "text" file is simply something needed to created the "images folder."
